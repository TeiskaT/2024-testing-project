> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- At first it was hard to put the theory in to practice. After studying the examples thoroughly writing the tests made more and more sense and I think I got the hang of it.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I studied the examples and wrote the test case based on those. I tried to write as consistently and logically as possible
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - Considering that this was my first touch with software testing I am unable to recommend any other tools or styles for test case management. Perhaps excel would be better for larger projects and then maybe tools that are dedicated only to software testing.    


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
I used Visual Studio Code to edit the files

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I did not


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
Github worked ok. I have used it in another course here at Laurea.

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
I would star with Robot Framework since it is recommended to teams with less experience in coding. Then I would use the best one for the given situation:
Appium for Mobile app testing
Cypress for Frontend (UI) testing of modern web applications 




## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Automation tools skills
- Programming knowledge
- Framework knowledge e.g. TestNG, JUnit, Cypress
- Understanding agile workflows, Scrum, and the role of automation in agile development processes
- Ability to design test cases, identify appropriate test conditions, and prioritize tests for execution
- Risk Assessment
- Communication
- Adaptability and Continuous Learning
- Strong teamwork abilities



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
I have strong soft skills but lack most of the forementioned technical skills for now. 




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
The theory of software testing is quite vast topic based on this course alone. Terminology, methodology, tools, practices and the basics were a lot to learn and I think I have only scrached the surface after this course. This project helped me to put the theory into practice and it would maybe have been helpful if there would have been a couple of assignments like this, but smaller, during the course.

The quizzes were difficult. The course book was good as were the videos in percipio as well as the material on Canvas.

All and all it would have helped me personally if there would have been a bit more practical assignments.
